    "Background:\n",
    "Basketball is one of the popular games played between two-team of five players each on a rectangular court. \n",
    "This game was invented by James W. Naismith I at YMCA training school in Massachusetts in an attempt to keep students fit \n",
    "during the freezing winter in the year 1891. The basic rule was whoever scores the most score by tossing through the \n",
    "opponentâ€™s basket wins the game. In order to oversee this game, 13 initial rules were introduced which are still followed \n",
    "today. Thereafter, the game of basketball spread quickly and never looked back as the structure was easy to understand for \n",
    "all, and with its growth new rules and regulations were formulated to govern the games of different levels of competition. \n",
    "With that note, there are many competitive leagues around the globe, and estimated 70,000+ professional basketball players \n",
    "showcase their skills and are featured in ultra-competitive games. Moreover, Statistics from the game played across various\n",
    "league are the key metrics to measuring players contribution in the games played and assist in understanding the team need \n",
    "to get your team playing the right way.\n",
    " \n",
    "Question:\n",
    "What and how does this collection of stats benefits players and their improvement towards the game?\n",
    "\n",
    "Idea:   \n",
    "The main idea here is to grab the stats of the NBA players with the highest order ranking based on the performances on the \n",
    "court of the national basketball leauge.The data collection will be centered on capturing The collected data further helps \n",
    "in understanding the efficiency of each player in various fields within a game i.e. minutes player per game, points scored\n",
    "per game,rebound per game,assist per game, steal per game, , turnover per game, the total number of a field goal attempt,\n",
    "and the total number of field goal made and more.Additionally, it also highlights players' association with the espective \n",
    "team and physical profiles of each player associated with the various leagues.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Possible result:\n",
    "This data may assist in understanding and analyzing the different metrics of the game to evaluate individual performance and\n",
    "suggest how productive a player performs on a per-minute basis. Also, this data helps in figuring each individual player \n",
    "efficiency by adding positive contributions (i.e. points made, blocks, rebounds, steals) a player makes on the court while \n",
    "subtracting negative contributions (i.e. turnovers, fouls, etc.) in a statistical point value system. \n",
    "\n",
    "Details in collecting the Data\n",

    "Based on the inspection of the HTML, we initially found:\n",

    "*Create a nested loop to loop through the Td and print them\n",

    "Create a varibale and add to them to value picked up from each column\n",
    "\n",
    "Reset the value of players record and get them added to the player data starting at index value '0'\n",
    "\n",
    "Print the Players record\n",
